# CHANGES.md

## [v1.3.0] - 2025-04-21
### Added
- 🚀 **GitHub Actions Workflow Setup**:
  - Created `.github/workflows/run.yaml` to run tests on `push` to `main` and `feature/git-workflow`, and on PRs targeting `main`.
  - Workflow includes steps for installing dependencies and running `pytest`.
- 🧪 **Unit testing support using `pytest`**:
  - Added `tests/test_endpoint.py` and `tests/test_utils.py` with basic test coverage.
  - Includes use of `assert` for verifying logic such as domain extraction and endpoint configuration.
- 🕒 **Availability cycle consistency**:
  - Health checks and logging now run every 15 seconds **regardless of number of endpoints or their response times**.
- 💬 **Inline requirement comments added**:
  - Documented requirement that endpoints must respond in **500ms or less** using code comments for clarity.

---

## [v1.2.0] - 2025-04-21
### Added
- ✅ **Graceful termination support using `KeyboardInterrupt` handler**:
  - `try-except` block in `main()` to catch `Ctrl+C` and log a friendly exit message.
  - Final stats are optionally logged when the script is interrupted.
- 🛠️ **Logging configuration using `logging.basicConfig`**:
  - Added `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(message)s')` for consistent and timestamped log formatting.
- 🔒 **Error handling for file and YAML issues**:
  - Added `FileNotFoundError` check for missing config file.
  - Added `yaml.YAMLError` exception handling for malformed YAML.

### Changed
- Updated `main()` to wrap the full endpoint loading and monitoring logic in error-safe blocks.

---

## [v1.1.0] - 2025-04-21
### Added
- **Made `method`, `headers`, and `body` optional in the `Endpoint` class constructor**:
  - Default values provided for missing fields (e.g., `method` defaults to `"GET"`, `headers` and `body` default to empty dictionaries).
  
### Fixed
- **Fixed TypeError in `Endpoint` initialization**:
  - The issue was caused by missing required arguments (`method`, `headers`, `body`) when they were not present in the input YAML.
  
### Changed
- **Updated `Endpoint` class constructor**:
  - The `__init__` method now supports optional arguments (`method`, `headers`, and `body`).
  
### Removed
- No changes removed in this version.

---

## [v1.0.0] - 2025-04-20
### Initial Release
- Endpoint monitoring script to check the health of multiple endpoints via HTTP requests.
- YAML-based configuration for endpoints.
- Logs success rates for each domain and endpoint.
